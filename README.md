## Introduction
CeLang stands for Certainty Language and it's being built to work with a logic circuit
simulation software I'm working on. It was built using Python and its main purpose is
to make the process of simulating a logic circuit in programming easier.

## Technologies
CeLang was built using Python 3.12.2 and Sly, a python module made specifically for
the purpose of writing a programming language.

## Usage
### Installation
As stated above, this python program requires the Python and the module Sly.
- To install Python on your system, follow the Python Documentation
- To install Sly on your system, simply run the command on your Terminal:
```
pip install sly
```
Once both Python and Sly are installed, simply run the file "CertaintyLang.py" with
the Python IDLE to start using CeLang.

### Operations
CeLang currently supports the following operations:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Exponentiation (^)

Usage of the above operations is seen below:
```
CeLang > 1+2
3
CeLang > 6-2
4
CeLang > 5*2
10
CeLang > 9/3
3
CeLang > 2^3
8
```
